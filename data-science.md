# Definitions
- Hyper-parameters: 
- Latent Vector ([Eigenvector](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html)): 
- Latent Variable: are variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred (through a mathematical model) from other variables that are observed (directly measured). One advantage of using latent variables is that they can serve to reduce the dimensionality of data.
- Scalar: A scalar is an element of a field which is used to define a vector space.
- Tensor: An element of the tensor product of N vector spaces
- Vector Space: a mathematical structure made up of vectors, objects that may be added with another vector or multiplied by a scalar value
- Vector: An element of a vector space
 


## Tensor
- Generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to multidimensional array
- Representation of an n-way interaction
  - Matrix represents a binary relation
- Difficult to visualize beyond 3rd order tensors
#### Tensors are used Everywhere
- Multiple Relations
